# Call Recorder Audio Quality & Call Detection Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to address the two main issues:
1. Poor audio quality with noise and echo
2. Recording starting even when not in a call

## 1. Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
**File:** `CallRecorder.Service/Audio/VoiceActivityDetector.cs` (NEW)

### Key Features:
- **Energy-based detection**: Analyzes audio energy levels to detect speech
- **Zero-crossing rate analysis**: Distinguishes voice from noise
- **Smoothing filters**: Reduces false positives from brief sounds
- **Voice frequency range detection**: Filters out non-voice sounds

## 2. Enhanced Call Detection
**File:** `CallRecorder.Service/Detection/CallDetectionEngine.cs`

### Improvements:
- **Voice-based detection**: Now detects actual voice/conversation, not just any audio
- **Dual-channel verification**: Requires voice activity on BOTH microphone and speakers
- **Confidence scoring**:
  - 85% confidence when both channels have voice activity (likely a call)
  - 50% confidence with partial voice activity
  - 20% for mic-only (probably not a call)
  - 15% for speaker-only (likely media playback)
- **Sustained activity requirement**: Needs 2+ consecutive detections to confirm a call
- **Longer timeouts**: 3-second timeout for voice to handle natural pauses

## 3. Improved Audio Processing (NLMS)
**File:** `CallRecorder.Service/Audio/NlmsAecProcessor.cs`

### Echo Cancellation Enhancements:
- **Longer filter length**: 45ms coverage (vs 20ms) for better echo suppression
- **Adaptive step size**: Faster convergence with Œº = 0.25
- **Double-talk detection**: Prevents filter corruption during simultaneous speech
- **Echo return loss monitoring**: Adjusts adaptation based on echo levels

### Noise Suppression Improvements:
- **2nd-order Butterworth high-pass filter**: Better low-frequency noise removal at 80Hz
- **Spectral subtraction**: Estimates and removes background noise floor
- **Nonlinear processing**: Suppresses residual echo below threshold
- **Comfort noise injection**: Prevents dead silence artifacts
- **Adaptive noise floor estimation**: Continuously learns background noise pattern

## 4. Recording Service Logic
**File:** `CallRecorder.Service/Hosted/CallRecordingService.cs`

### Smarter Recording Control:
- **2-second confirmation**: Requires stable call detection before starting
- **8 consecutive inactive detections**: Prevents stopping during brief pauses
- **Minimum call duration**: Enforces 3-second minimum (configurable)
- **Better logging**: Clear status indicators (üìû ‚úÖ ‚è±Ô∏è)

## 5. Configuration Optimizations
**File:** `CallRecorder.Service/appsettings.json`

### Settings Updated:
```json
{
  "CallDetection": {
    "PollIntervalMs": 250,        // Faster polling (was 500)
    "ConfidenceThreshold": 75,    // Higher threshold (was 70)
    "MinimumCallDurationSeconds": 3  // Shorter minimum (was 5)
  },
  "AudioDsp": {
    "Agc": true,                  // Automatic gain control enabled
    "SuppressionLevel": "High"    // Maximum noise suppression
  }
}
```

## Expected Results

### Audio Quality Improvements:
‚úÖ **Reduced echo** through longer NLMS filter and better double-talk detection  
‚úÖ **Less background noise** via spectral subtraction and high-pass filtering  
‚úÖ **Clearer voice** with AGC and nonlinear processing  
‚úÖ **No dead silence** through comfort noise injection  

### Call Detection Improvements:
‚úÖ **No false triggers** from music, videos, or system sounds  
‚úÖ **Accurate call detection** using voice activity on both channels  
‚úÖ **Handles conversation pauses** with longer timeouts  
‚úÖ **Filters out short sounds** with minimum duration requirements  

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Voice Detection**:
   - Make a real phone call and verify recording starts
   - Play music/video and verify NO recording starts
   - Have silence and verify NO recording starts

2. **Test Audio Quality**:
   - Check if echo is reduced in recordings
   - Verify background noise is suppressed
   - Ensure voice remains clear and natural

3. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Brief pauses in conversation shouldn't stop recording
   - Very short calls (< 3 seconds) should be discarded
   - Background typing or clicking shouldn't trigger recording

## Further Improvements (Optional)

If audio quality still needs improvement, consider:

1. **WebRTC Integration**: Add native WebRTC audio processing DLL for professional-grade processing
2. **Machine Learning VAD**: Use pre-trained models for more accurate voice detection
3. **Frequency Analysis**: Add FFT-based spectral analysis for better noise profiling
4. **Process-based Detection**: Monitor specific applications (Teams, Zoom, etc.) for calls
