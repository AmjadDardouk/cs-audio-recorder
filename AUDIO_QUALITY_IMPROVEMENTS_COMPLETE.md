## ðŸ“‹ Testing with Real Audio Recording

### Quick Test Procedure:

1. **Build and run the service:**
   ```bash
   dotnet build CallRecorder.Service
   dotnet run --project CallRecorder.Service
   ```

2. **Check the logs for device selection:**
   - Look for "Selected microphone" and "Selected speaker" messages
   - Verify high-quality devices are being chosen
   - Confirm sample rates of 44.1kHz or higher

3. **Make a test call and record:**
   - Start a voice/video call on your computer
   - The service should automatically detect and start recording
   - Audio files will be saved in the configured output directory

4. **Analyze the recorded audio:**
   ```python
   # Use the provided analysis tool
   python tools/analyze_wav.py path/to/recorded/file.wav
   ```

### What to Expect:

- **Clear, professional audio quality** - No distortion or clipping
- **Balanced volume levels** - Consistent loudness without manual adjustment
- **Reduced background noise** - Minimal hiss, hum, or environmental noise
- **Good stereo separation** - Left channel (mic) and right channel (speakers) clearly separated
- **No echo or feedback** - Advanced echo cancellation working
- **High dynamic range** - Full range from quiet to loud sounds preserved

### Configuration Customization:

All settings can be adjusted in the configuration files:
- `RecordingConfig` - Audio format and quality settings
- `AudioDeviceConfig` - Device selection preferences  
- `AudioDspConfig` - Audio processing parameters
